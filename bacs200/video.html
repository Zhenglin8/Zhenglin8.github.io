                    <h2>Script</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone, my name is Zheng Xian Lin ( But people in school call me Jack Lin as my school name). 
                    This is my four years at the University of Northern Colorado in Greeley and currently pursuing a degree 
                    in Finance. A little bit about myself.  I was born in Sothen China but I live in the CO for 11 years now. 
                    I graduated from a high school named Windsor high school. Graduation from high school apply to UNC back in
                    2018. Back then when I started to study at UNC I start with a nursing major. It was based on my father's 
                    influence. He keeps talking about all the benefits you get on nursing as a job but the sooner I found 
                    out pre-nursing doesn't fit with my personality so I decided to change to business finance well time 
                    flies by it is my fourth year now on UNC. I enjoyed investing that's one of the reasons I study Finance
                    as my degree. some of the things I like include fishing hiking and a little bit of gaming just for fun. 
                    My greatest skill is that I have patience with other people and I do well working with others. I know
                    how to talk to people in different environments. I also speak Chinese which I think would be a helpful
                    skill to have especially in the u.s because there is a need in the u.s. for someone who speaks Chinese
                    fluently. I'm also a quick learner in different environments.  as I mentioned above are my greatest skills.
                    I'm planning to apply for an internship in the banking area I will use all those skills to help the company
                    grow and also improve myself as time goes by.

                                 <img src="https://degree.unco.edu/images/unco-pic-about.jpg">
            <p> Over the years of my unvirsity journeys. I encounter endless people, but the most inspire are UNCO teachers and my parents.</p>
            <p> Teacher taught us never to give up and teachers want students to be successful in their lifes.</p>
            <p> In the same way as the parents, but most importantly my parents want me to be happy about my lifes.</p>
            <P> I believe every kids in the familly will beileve their parents are heros.

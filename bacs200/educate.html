    <h3>Bill Gates- Teachers need real feedback</h3>
    <p> Summary/Introduction</p>
    <p> Until recently, many teachers only got one word of feedback a year: "satisfactory." And with no feedback,
        no coaching, there's just no way to improve. Bill Gates suggests that even great teachers can get better
        with smart feedback and lays out a program from his foundation to bring it to every classroom. </P>

    <h2>RSA Animate</h2>
    <h3>Abi Stephenson, Cognitive Media, Ha-Joon Chang - Economics is for Everyone!</h3>
    <p> Summary/Introduction</p>
    <p> ‘Economics is for everyone’, argues legendary economist Ha-Joon Chang in our latest mind-blowing RSA Animate. </p>
        This is the video economists don’t want you to see! Chang explains why every single person can and SHOULD get</p>
        their head around basic economics. He pulls back the curtain on the often mystifying language of derivatives </p>
        and quantitative easing, and explains how easily economic myths and assumptions become gospel. Arm yourself </p>
        with some facts, and get involved in discussions about the fundamentals that underpin our day-to-day lives. </p>

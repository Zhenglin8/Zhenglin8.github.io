    <h2>RSA Animate</h2>
    <h3>Abi Stephenson, Cognitive Media, Ha-Joon Chang - Economics is for Everyone!</h3>

        and quantitative easing, and explains how easily economic myths and assumptions become gospel. Arm yourself </p>
        with some facts, and get involved in discussions about the fundamentals that underpin our day-to-day lives. </p>

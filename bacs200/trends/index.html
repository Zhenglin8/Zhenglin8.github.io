                      Innovation and development have not stopped in the social
                      and content fields that seem to have entered a mature period.
                      On the contrary, with the rapid development of the Internet,
                      the importance of content has become increasingly prominent.
                      It is like water without a source. In 2018 was a hot year for 
                      short videos. Tik Tok, the main short video social networking
                      platform, reached 500 million monthly lives, and the content
                      social e-commerce company Xiaohongshu exceeded 50 million 
                      monthly lives. Social and content consumption have long been 
                      integrated into our daily lives and socialized. And content
                      marketing has become the mainstream marketing model for brands
                      to reach users.

                      development of the Internet + era and peopleâ€™s growing desire
                      for knowledge. Traditional offline education is also indirectly 
                      driven by the massive consumption of time, space and cost. This 
                      has contributed to the development of online education, because 
                      the most significant feature of online education is the freedom in
                      time and the low restriction of space. Compared with offline education,
                      the cost of output and acquisition of online education is relatively low,
                      which is conducive to long-term develop.

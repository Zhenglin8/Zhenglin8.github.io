                <p>The new crown epidemic is the awakening of history
                   and a concentrated manifestation of typical historical 
                   scenes. Usually we are used to the surface of ordinary life,
                   but the storm of the epidemic has opened a historical perspective 
                   to us. In some respects, the impact of the epidemic on human
                   society is short-term and temporary, but the chain reactio
                   it stimulates may be long-term.</P>

                <h3>Economic implications</h3>
                <p> When the new crown pneumonia has become a global pandemic,
                    the extent of its impact on the global economy is also a 
                    major issue that worries the world.Reference is also defined
                    as a global pandemic H1N1 influenza. According to the Bank of
                    Mexico, it led to a reduction in GDP of approximately 5.3% in
                    Mexico, where it first occurred, and an economic loss of tens
                    of billions of dollars. Looking back at SARS, which has also
                    spread to the world, according to statistics from the Brookings
                    Institution, a think tank in the United States, SARS caused
                    about 40 billion U.S. dollars in losses to the global economy
                    that year. In contrast, the new crown virus is more cunning-it
                    is more infectious than SARS and has a higher fatality rate than
                    influenza, which makes the global impact of the epidemic more
                    widespread.</p>
